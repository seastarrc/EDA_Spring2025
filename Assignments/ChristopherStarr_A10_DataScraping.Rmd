## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on data scraping. 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A10_DataScraping.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure your code is tidy; use line breaks to ensure your code fits in the knitted output.
5. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.


## Set up 
1. Set up your session:

* Load the packages `tidyverse`, `rvest`, and any others you end up using.
* Check your working directory

```{r 1. Project Setup, message = FALSE}
#1 
#Install familiar packages
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("dataRetrieval")
install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidyverse);library(lubridate);library(viridis);library(here)
here()

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

install.packages("rvest")
library(rvest)

install.packages('xml2')
library('xml2')

install.packages("dataRetrieval")
library(dataRetrieval)

install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)

# Set theme
mytheme <- theme_gray() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)

```

2. We will be scraping data from the NC DEQs Local Water Supply Planning website, specifically the Durham's 2024 Municipal Local Water Supply Plan (LWSP): 
 * Navigate to https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/search.php
 * Scroll down and select the LWSP link next to Durham Municipality. 
 * Note the web address: <https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2024>
 
Indicate this website as the as the URL to be scraped. (In other words, read the contents into an `rvest` webpage object.)

```{r set.the.scraping.website}
#2

# Specify the URL
url <- "https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2024"

# Read the HTML content
webpage <- read_html(url)

```

3. The data we want to collect are listed below:

* From the "1. System Information" section:
 * Water system name
 * PWSID
 * Ownership
 
* From the "3. Water Supply Sources" section:
 * Maximum Day Use (MGD) - for each month

In the code chunk below scrape these values, assigning them to four separate variables.

>HINT: The first value should be "Durham", the second "03-32-010", the third "Municipality", and the last should be a vector of 12 numeric values (represented as strings)".

```{r scrape.the.data}
#3 
# Extract water system name
water_system_name <- page %>%
  html_nodes("td") %>%
  .[grep("Water System Name", html_text(.))] %>%
  html_text() %>%
  strsplit(":") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  .[2] %>%
  trimws()

# Extract PWSID
pwsid <- page %>%
  html_nodes("td:nth-child(2)") %>%
  .[grep("03-32-010", html_text(.))] %>%
  html_text() %>%
  trimws()

# Extract ownership
ownership <- page %>%
  html_nodes("tr:nth-child(2) td") %>%
  .[grep("Municipality", html_text(.))] %>%
  html_text() %>%
  trimws()

# Extract Maximum Day Use for each month
max_day_row <- page %>%
  html_nodes("tr") %>%
  .[grep("Max Day", html_text(.))]

# Get the values from the Max Day row
max_day_use <- max_day_row %>%
  html_nodes("td") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  .[grepl("[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+", .)]

```


4. Convert your scraped data into a dataframe. This dataframe should have a column for each of the 4 variables scraped and a row for the month corresponding to the withdrawal data. Also add a Date column that includes your month and year in data format. (Feel free to add a Year column too, if you wish.)

>TIP: Use `rep()` to repeat a value when creating a dataframe.

>NOTE: It's likely you won't be able to scrape the monthly widthrawal data in chronological order. You can overcome this by creating a month column manually assigning values in the order the data are scraped: "Jan", "May", "Sept", "Feb", etc... Or, you could scrape month values from the web page...

5. Create a line plot of the maximum daily withdrawals across the months for 2024, making sure, the months are presented in proper sequence.

```{r create.a.dataframe.from.scraped.data}
#4 


#5 


```

6. Note that the PWSID and the year appear in the web address for the page we scraped. Construct a function with two input - "PWSID" and "year" - that:
  - Creates a URL pointing to the LWSP for that PWSID for the given year
  - Creates a website object and scrapes the data from that object (just as you did above)
  - Constructs a dataframe from the scraped data, mostly as you did above, but includes the PWSID and year provided as function inputs in the dataframe. 
  - Returns the dataframe as the function's output


```{r construct.a.scraping.function}
#6. 


```

7. Use the function above to extract and plot max daily withdrawals for Durham (PWSID='03-32-010') for each month in 2020

```{r fetch.and.plot.Durham.2020.data}
#7 


```

8. Use the function above to extract data for Asheville (PWSID = '01-11-010') in 2020. Combine this data with the Durham data collected above and create a plot that compares Asheville's to Durham's water withdrawals.

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.2020.data}
#8 


```


9. Use the code & function you created above to plot Asheville's max daily withdrawal by months for the years 2018 thru 2023.Add a smoothed line to the plot (method = 'loess').

> TIP: See Section 3.2 in the "10_Data_Scraping.Rmd" where we apply "map2()" to iteratively run a function over two inputs. Pipe the output of the map2() function to `bindrows()` to combine the dataframes into a single one, and use that to construct your plot.

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.multiyear.data }
#9 


```

Question: Just by looking at the plot (i.e. not running statistics), does Asheville have a trend in water usage over time?
